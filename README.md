# deep-learning-challenge
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.

DATA REPROCESSING: target variable for this model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL"

FEATURES OF MODEL : application_type, classification

ACHEIVE TARGET MODEL PERFORMANCE: no, never reached 75%

STEPS I TOOK IN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE MODEL PERFORMANCE:  I changed the amount of epochs, and number of neurons in the layers and this also seemed to increase the accuracy 

VARIABLES SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE INPUT DATA BECAUSE THEYRE NOT TARGETS NOR FEATURES: EIN, the NAME column.

SUMMARY: Finally the model was able to predict data with a 73% accuracy
